# http://www.idlenexus.net/ Concrete5 Theme

This Theme is a heavily modified version of the Salt & Pepper theme found at 

http://templated.co/saltpepper

It is much more complete than the original. I spent hours tweaking it, carving
it up, adding panels, and theming the remaining single pages (login, etc) of 
the base concrete5 site.

The basic concept, color scheme, and background images are original.

The Banner image is a slightly modified version of a lovely image I found on
the internet. I could not find the original author's information. You may
find it and others like it using this search https://goo.gl/nC4F6E
